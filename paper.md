# Summary

Scientific software has advanced significantly over the last few decades,
with innumerable tools and resources openly available for use by
researchers and the public alike. These software products all undergo
unique development lifecycles tailored to the needs to specific developers.
Although the scientific quality and usefulness of such products is unquestionable,
they often have steep learning curves that make using and coupling these products
difficult to manage. `porchlight` offers a solution to this problem in the form
of a basic adapter/mediator framework---capable of parsing function metadata,
tracking variable stats, and managing dynamically updating functions, it saves
many lines of code otherwise required to create a simple API or couple to another
disparate piece of software.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
