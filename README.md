[porchlight](https://porchlight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
==========

`porchlight` is a function management suite that handles common inputs and
outputs of methods and/or functions which evolve over the lifetime of a program.

This package's original intent was to be a part of a modular scientific package
yet to be released. Rather than isolating this method to a single model, the
already-developed work has been modified to stand alone as a package.

`porchlight` does not have any dependencies outside of the standard CPython
library. Please note that `porchlight` requires Python 3.9\+, and that examples
may require external libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

Installation
------------

You can install `porchlight` by cloning this repository to a local directory,
opening a command line, and running:
```pip install porchlight```

Usage
-----

The main object used in `porchlight` is the `porchlight.Neighborhood` object.
This groups all functions together and keeps track of call order and
parameters.

```python
import porchlight


# We call a porchlight.Neighborhood object to instantiate it with no functions
# yet.
neighborhood = porchlight.Neighborhood()

# To add a function, we simply define it and pass it to porchlight.
def increase_x(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    x = x * y
    return x

neighborhood.add_function(increase_x)

# The neighborhood object inspects the function, finding input and output
# variables if present. These are added to the collections of functions and
# parameters.
print(neighborhood)
```

Although this is the current extent of documentation, there should be some more
complete documentation within the next couple weeks/months.
