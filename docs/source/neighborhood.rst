=====================

`neighborhood` contains the |Neighborhood| class, which acts as a mediator
class between different functions that have been re-cast as
:py:class:`~porchlight.door.Door` objects.

.. automodule:: porchlight.neighborhood
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:
    :private-members:

.. |Neighborhood| replace:: :py:class:`~porchlight.neighborhood.Neighborhood`
